```

1. Let's first load the nobels.csv file from the data-raw/ folder:

```{r label-me1, eval=FALSE}
nobel <- ___(___)
```

2. Then let's split the data into two new data frames called `nobel_stem` (which filters for the STEM fields: Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, and Economics) and `nobel_nonstem` that includes the remaining fields. 
```{r label-me2, eval=FALSE}
# stem laureates
___ <- nobel %>%
  filter(___)

# non-steam laureates
___ <- nobel %>%
  filter(___)
```

3. And finally write the resulting data frames to .csv files called nobel-stem.csv and nobel-nostem.csv to the data/ folder.
```{r label-me3}
# add code for writing out the two data frames here
```
